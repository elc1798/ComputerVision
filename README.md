# ComputerVision by elc1798

This repository consists of some, if not all, the code I wrote for the Stuyvesant High School FRC Robotics Team, StuyPulse, Team 694.
The official team Github repository for computer vision is private, but I felt that open sourcing my own code is okay.

This repository is dedicated to StuyPulse, who gave me unforgettable memories of pure amazingness. Let the cheers of 694 be heard.
